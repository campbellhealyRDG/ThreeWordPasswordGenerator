📌 Notes:
The WORD_LIST_URL points to a common MIT-hosted 10,000-word list.

If you want a different list, replace the URL with any plaintext file with one word per line (e.g., GitHub raw files, your own hosted file).

requests is included in most Python installations; if needed, install it via:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
Let me know if you’d like the script to cache the list locally after the first fetch, or if you want HTTPS validation/logging added.
